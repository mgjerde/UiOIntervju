# PRE-INTERVIEW ASSIGNMENT

Thank you for your interest in the position. Before we take you in for
an interview, we would like to ask you to solve the following
tasks. Give it 1 to 3 hours of your best effort and email the source
code back to us.

Good luck! :)

## TASKS

1. The program below contains a bug, tagged with a FIXME comment in
the code. Fix it, changing as little code as necessary. Save the
result as task1.py.

2. With the result from task 1, refactor the code to make it easier to read,
maintain, and extend. You may also rewrite the program using a different
programming language or framework if you are feeling creative. Save the result
as task2.\<whatever\>

3. With the result from task 2 as your starting point, implement the
feature specified below. Save the result as task3.py (or
task3.\<whatever\> if you use another language).

        Specification: There should be a finite amount of servings for each
        dish on the menu, i.e. 15 Dagens, 2 Vegetar, 5 Halal. Requesting a
        dish that has no servings left should return the message "Sorry, no more left of <dish name> today."

            Example run:
            What would you like today? (type 'how is business?' to attempt small talk, or 'not hungry' to stop)

            > Vegetar
            Vegetar, here you go.
            What would you like today? (type 'how is business?' to attempt small talk, or 'not hungry' to stop)

            > Vegetar
            Vegetar, here you go.
            What would you like today? (type 'how is business?' to attempt small talk, or 'not hungry' to stop)

            > Vegetar
            Sorry, no more left of <Vegetar> today.
            What would you like today? (type 'how is business?' to attempt small talk, or 'not hungry' to stop)
